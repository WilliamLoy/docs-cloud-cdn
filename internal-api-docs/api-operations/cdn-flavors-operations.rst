A flavor is a mapping configuration to a CDN provider. Each flavor may contain a list of providers. The operator can decide the flavor names offered and the mapping to each provider offered.

The section describes the flavors operations in the Rackspace CDN Administration API.

Access to these endpoints should be controlled via an RBAC system such as Repose.
