Rackspace CDN Version 1.0 API Developer Guide
=========================================================

The Rackspace CDN service gives you the power to accelerate content on any public resource at Rackspace. It provides a simple API and Control Panel experience for you to manage your CDN-enabled domains and the origins and assets associated with those domains. The API uses  a simple Representational State Transfer (REST) web service interface.

The Rackspace CDN FAQ in the Knowledge Center provides more information about the Rackspace CDN service.
