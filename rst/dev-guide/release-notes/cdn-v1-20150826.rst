API |contract version| updates, August 26, 2015
-----------------------------------------------

What's new
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Added cache invalidation to the :ref:`Purge a cached
   asset <cdn-purge-a-cached-asset>` operation by adding the 
   ``hard`` query parameter. The default value for 
   ``hard`` is set to ``false``, which does cache invalidation,
   while setting ``hard`` to ``true`` does an actual purge.

-  Added ``access`` with valid values of ``whitelist`` and ``blacklist``
   to ``restrictions`` for the :ref:`Create a service <cdn-create-a-service>`
   operation to allow or block access.

-  Added ``request_url`` and ``client_ip`` to ``rules`` for the 
   :ref:`Create a service <cdn-create-a-service>` operation to 
   enable restriction rules for URLs and IP addresses.

-  Made a change so that new services are now created with a default TTL
   for ``/*``. You see this default TTL in the ``rules`` section of the
   service.


Resolved issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fixed an issue to now disallow entering a root domain for the domain
   field in a service.

-  Fixed an issue where now a TTL of 0 seconds is treated as “no-cache”
   with Akamai.
