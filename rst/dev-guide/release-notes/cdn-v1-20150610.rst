What's new
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Rackspace CDN has been updated to allow HTTP traffic on an SSL
   domain. Consequently, the *Rackspace CDN Developer Guide* has been
   updated. The ``protocol`` parameter description for the request in
   :ref:`Create a service <cdn-create-a-service>` has been changed. 
   The statement that indicated that domains must use the same protocol 
   has been deleted.
