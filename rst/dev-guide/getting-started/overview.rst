Overview
-----------------------

A content delivery network (CDN) is designed to improve the performance
of publicly distributed assets.  Assets can be anything from website
content, to web application components, to media like videos, ads, and
interactive experiences.  CDNs decrease the load time of these assets by
caching them on edge nodes, which are also called edge servers or point
of presence (PoP) servers.  Edge nodes are distributed around the globe,
and they cache content and serve it directly to customers, thus reducing
transit time to a customer's location. 

Rackspace CDN gives you the power to accelerate content on any public
resource at Rackspace. It provides a simple API and Control Panel
experience for you to manage your CDN-enabled domains and the origins
and assets associated with those domains. 

The Rackspace CDN architecture includes the following components:

-  A RESTful API

-  The ability to cache publicly accessible resources hosted on a Cloud
   Server instance, or a public Cloud Files container

-  A single global endpoint to access the API

-  Use of the Akamai Technologies's content delivery network, which is
   one of the world's largest distributed computing platforms

This guide explains how to access and start using the API so that you
can begin to use Rackspace CDN for your applications. Instructions are
given for how to properly enter the necessary URLs, use cURL, and set up
and use a basic set of Rackspace CDN operations.

You can find additional details about Rackspace CDN in the :ref:`Developer Guide <developer-guide>`.
