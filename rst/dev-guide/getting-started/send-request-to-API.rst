Send requests to the API
--------------------------

You have several options for sending requests through an API:

-  Developers and testers might prefer to use cURL, the command-line
   tool from http://curl.haxx.se/.

   With cURL, you can send HTTP requests and receive responses back from
   the command line. cURL is used in this guide.

-  If you like to use a more graphical interface, the REST client for
   Mozilla Firefox works well for testing and trying out commands. See
   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/.

-  You can download and install RESTClient, a Java application used to
   test RESTful web services, from
   http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/.
